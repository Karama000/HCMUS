        <h1>This is all about formatting</h1>
        <p>We know that the internet is a wonderful place to visit but why do some things on a web page catch out eye more than others. It is because of th <i>formatting</i> and the <b>emphasis</b> of different elements to a page. <b>Bold</b> <i>italic</i> <u>underline</u> <i>em</i> and <b>strong</b> are all tags than can be used for this task.</p>
